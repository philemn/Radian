<p>
    As it currently stands, Radian does absolutely nothing with the free-form content found in
    Content Item files.  I'm not sure if I see that changing anytime soon.  However, I do think it
    would be great if people who choose to build on top of the framework could specify their own
    formatters which would translate the contents into HTML.

    I had originally thought about baking in support for MarkDown, but then I realized that there
    are several other formats that people may be interested in.  My current thought is that people
    should be able to bring their own formatters and they can be registered against the file
    extension of the content item.

    I'm curious to hear your thoughts though.  Do share!  That reminds me, this blog really needs a
    About/Contact page so watch for that soon.
