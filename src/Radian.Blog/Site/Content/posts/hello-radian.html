	It's tough to pinpoint exactly where the inspiration for Radian came from.  Content management is
	something that has been pretty near and dear to my heart for quite some time.  I have long felt
	that the majority of solutions available are overly complex and unnatural to use for either the
	developers or content authors.  Radian doesn't seek to directly solve all of that.  Instead,
	Radian is simply a conscious choice to choose simplicity over complexity and extensibility over
	opinion.
</p>
<p>
    When I sat down to think about what made sense to me in a content management system I came up with
	a limited set of core concepts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	    <strong>Content Items</strong> &ndash;
		Files stored on disk in a Site folder that begin with a JSON header that contains what other
		content management systems refer to as fields or properties.  Beneath that is free-form body
		content.  Many content management systems do nothing more than manage the display of chunks
		of HTML.  Radian can do that too, but that's just an option.
    </li>
	<li>
	    <strong>Pages</strong> &ndash;
		This concept should be pretty obvious.  Pages define what content gets displayed at a given
		URL.  The specified url can contain tokens which can be used in Queries which are described
		below.
    </li>
	<li>
	    <strong>Layouts</strong> &ndash;
		Like a WordPress theme, a Layout is an HTML document which specifies where specific sections
		of a Page should be displayed.  If you're not familiar with WordPress, think master pages
		or Razor layouts.
	</li>
	<li>
	    <strong>Views</strong> &ndash;
		A piece of content can take many different forms on a dynamic website.  It can be presented
		in a summary of search results or in a full-blown detail view.  Views are used to transform
		content into a specific HTML representation.
	</li>
	<li>
	    <strong>Queries</strong> &ndash;
		With the 4 items above, it would be perfectly possible to build a static website.  This has
		been done several times and done very well I might add.  Radian allows you to describe
		queries over your content so that you can choose which Content Item or Items should be
		displayed.  Radian supports a very robust language for Queries which I will go into more
		detail about in a later post.  For now, just know that Radian supports LINQ queries and also
		supports Full-Text searching over Content Items.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Radian is a proof-of-concept, and it's bringing you this blog.  The concept has been proven but
	I plan to continue to build upon it.  I believe that there are several interesting scenarios
	for Radian.  I hope that people see enough potential in the Radian platform to build their own
	management tools.  Although this blog is running on Radian, it has been put together by simply
	creating and modifying files on my machine.  It would be exciting to see people build tools
	which define types of content and editors for creating Content Items.
