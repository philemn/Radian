<p>
    When I started Radian I thought that Queries would be a nice to have.  After having implemented
    them I feel confident I feel validated in that opinion.  Radian originally existed after a few
    hours of hacking.  I had the basics implement: Content Items, Pages, and Views.  This was
    arguably enough to build this blog with although it felt rather trivial.  After all, I could
    have come extremely close with a bunch of static HTML pages.  For years I have viewed Content
    Queries as a powerful piece of a CMS platform.  I knew I needed to make them work somehow.

    If you're not familiar with the inner-workings of Radian, allow me to bring you up to speed.
    Radian works with a general text file format.  The file begins with a JSON header and then
    optionally contains any other free-form content.  Content Items, Pages, and Layouts all share
    this file format.  When I set out to define a Query file, it seemed logical to choose the same
    file format.  Queries are defined as simple JSON files.  Currently the JSON has terrible
    property names, "map" and "limit", but these are likely to change and other properties may be
    added if necessary.  The thought though was that it would be great to define queries in a syntax
    similar to LINQ, but taking care of the tasks of parsing such a query would prove challenging ...
    until Roslyn.

    I realized that with Roslyn I could build a tool that would query against Radian files on disk
    using actual LINQ expressions.  The current Radian codebase is in need of some serious
    refactoring at the moment.  If you take a look you'll see that I took what was a command-line
    tool for querying content and slapped it into the web framework.  At some point in the future
    I'll break that out into it's own utility.  If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to send me a
    pull request.
